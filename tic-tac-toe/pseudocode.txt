1. Define the main package and import necessary packages
2. Define constants for the board size and players
3. Define a struct for the game state
4. Initialize the game state
5. Define a function to print the game board
6. Define a function to check for a win
7. Define a function to check for a draw
8. Define a function to handle player moves
9. Define the main game loop
10. Implement the main function to start the game

// Code Implementation
1. package main
2. import "fmt"

3. const (
       BoardSize = 3
       PlayerX = 'X'
       PlayerO = 'O'
   )

4. type GameState struct {
       board [BoardSize][BoardSize]rune
       currentPlayer rune
   }

5. func initializeGame() *GameState {
       Initialize an empty board
       Set the current player to PlayerX
       Return the initialized game state
   }

6. func printBoard(game *GameState) {
       Print the current state of the board
   }

7. func checkWin(game *GameState) bool {
       Check rows, columns, and diagonals for a win
       Return true if a win is detected, otherwise false
   }

8. func checkDraw(game *GameState) bool {
       Check if all cells are filled and no win is detected
       Return true if it's a draw, otherwise false
   }

9. func handleMove(game *GameState, row int, col int) bool {
       If the cell at (row, col) is empty, place the current player's mark
       Switch the current player
       Return true if the move is valid, otherwise false
   }

10. func mainLoop() {
        Initialize the game
        While the game is not over:
            Print the board
            Prompt the current player for a move
            If the move is valid:
                Check for a win
                If a win is detected, print the winner and exit
                Check for a draw
                If a draw is detected, print a draw message and exit
            If the move is invalid, prompt again
    }

11. func main() {
        Start the main game loop
    }
